## Questions

### Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services: Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit?     
I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework. Because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to it’s more simple and more user friendly to us. Robot Framework has more complex structure comparing to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit.
