## Questions

### Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services: Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit?     
I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework. Because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to itâ€™s more simple and more user friendly to us. Robot Framework has more complex structure comparing to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit.
